## Summary
Essentially all the alarms generated by Acto for this operator are simple misoperations. The vulnerability of this operator to misoperations seems to be understood and is documented in this github issue: https://github.com/OT-CONTAINER-KIT/redis-operator/issues/490

# ALARM 1
trial-00-0059/0001

## What happened
When acto adds a sidecar with invalid parameters to the spec, a pod crashes.

## Root Cause
The spec does not specify a valid sidecar. The operator code attempts to update the `SatetfullSet`  with the updated spec in `k8sutils/satefulset.go` without performing any validation on the statefulset spec. The sidecar image in the spec is not valid so when the cluster restarts it repeatedly fails as it is unable to create a pod with the invalid sidecar spec.

## Expected behavior?
This is a misoperation. The operator should be able to easily reject the new spec as the sidecar spec does not specify a valid container

# ALARM 2
trial-02-0059/0001

## What happened
Same as ALARM 1 except with an array of invalid sidecars.

# ALARM 3
trial-02-0059/0001

## What happened
When acto adds a TLS configuration with invalid parameters to the spec, a pod crashes.

## Root Cause
The spec does not specify a valid TLS cert. The operator code attempts to update the `SatetfullSet`  with the updated spec in `k8sutils/satefulset.go` without performing any validation on the statefulset spec. When the cluster restarts it repeatedly fails as it is unable to create a pod with the invalid TLS spec

## Expected behavior?
This is a misoperation. The operator should be able to easily reject the new spec as the TLS spec does not specify a valid cert.

# ALARM 4
trial-01-0042/0001

## What happened
Same as ALARM 3.

# ALARM 5
trial-02-0040/0001

## What happened
Same as ALARM 3.

# ALARM 6
trial-00-0051/0001

## What happened
When acto adds a `RedisSecret` with "ACTOKEY" as the key, the pod enters an unhealthy state.

## Root Cause
The operator assumes that the `RedisSecret` field will specify a password for Redis. As such it assumes that the value of key will be "password" and that the name will be a valid password. The operator only checks if `RedisSecret` has been defined and does not check if name as been specified. As such when the operator attempts to create a pod with the new spec, it fails when it tries to get the name that is not specified. For example at: https://github.com/OT-CONTAINER-KIT/redis-operator/blob/891d740293ab27ee8502f212088d05e0b29cb15f/k8sutils/redis.go#L113.

## Expected behavior?
This is a misoperation. The operator should be able to easily reject the spec as the password is not properly specified. 


# ALARM 7
trial-01-0044/0001

## What happened
Same as ALARM 6.

# ALARM 8
trial-01-0045/0001

## What happened
Same as ALARM 6.

# ALARM 9
trial-00-0051/0001

## What happened
When acto adds a `service` with "ClusterIP" as the `serviceType`, the pod enters an unhealthy state.

## Root Cause
The operator assumes that the `service` will specify a valid service, either a load balancer, node port, or cluster IP. However, it does not check if all the fields are specified or if they are valid. In this test case since only the `serviceType` is specified, the operator fails to create a pod with the new spec.

## Expected behavior?
This is a misoperation. The operator should be able to easily reject the spec as the service is not properly defined. 

# ALARM 10
trial-01-0045/0001

## What happened
Similar to ALARM 9. Only `annotation` is specified within `service`.

# ALARM 11
trial-01-0025/0001

## What happened
Similar to ALARM 9. Only `annotation` is invalid.

# ALARM 12
trial-01-0026/0001

## What happened
Same as ALARM 11.

# ALARM 13
trial-01-0031/0001

## What happened
Same as ALARM 11.

# ALARM 14
trial-01-0023/0001

## What happened
Same as ALARM 11.

# ALARM 15
trial-03-0005/0001

## What happened
Same as ALARM 9

# ALARM 16
trial-03-0006/0001

## What happened
Similar to ALARM 9 but "LoadBalancer" is specified instead.

# ALARM 17
trial-03-0007/0001

## What happened
Similar to ALARM 9 but "NodePort" is specified instead.

# ALARM 18
trial-03-0008/0001

## What happened
Same as alarm 9.

# ALARM 19
trial-00-0003/0001

## What happened
When acto adds a RedisLeader configuration but specifies invalid values for "Tolerations" in the spec, a pod crashes.

## Root Cause
The spec does specifies invalid values such as "ACTOKEY" for each of the fields. The operator code attempts to update the `SatetfullSet`  with the updated spec in `k8sutils/satefulset.go` without performing any validation on the statefulset spec. When the cluster restarts it repeatedly fails as it is unable to create a pod with the invalid RedisLeader spec.

## Expected behavior?
This is a misoperation. The operator should be able to perform some validation on the tolerations before accepting the spec. For example, the "operator" and "effect" fields could be enums to avoid invalid values.

# ALARM 20
trial-00-0004/0001

## What happened
Similar to ALARM 19. But none of the necesary fields for "tolerations" are specified.

# ALARM 21
trial-00-0005/0001

## What happened
Same as ALARM 19.

# ALARM 33
trial-00-0023/0001

## What happened
When acto adds "initContainer" options with invalid parameters to the spec, a pod crashes.

## Root Cause
The spec does not specify a valid image for the initialization options. The operator code attempts to update the `SatetfullSet`  with the updated spec in `k8sutils/satefulset.go` without performing any validation on the statefulset spec. The pod then crashes when it tries to reconcile the state as it cannot find the requested image.

## Expected behavior?
This is a misoperation. The operator should be able to easily reject the new spec does not specify a valid container

# ALARM 66
trial-00-0016/0001

## What happened
When acto adds a resource limit on a resource that does not exist on the cluster the pod enters an unhealthy state.

## Root Cause
The spec does not specify a valid sidecar. The operator code attempts to update the `SatetfullSet`  with the updated spec in `k8sutils/satefulset.go` without performing any validation on the statefulset spec. The requested resource limit is not valid so when the cluster restarts it repeatedly fails as it is unable to create a pod as it cannot find the resource.

## Expected behavior?
This is a misoperation. The operator should be able to reject the spec by checking if the limit is on a resource that actually exists in the cluster.

# ALARM 67
trial-00-0017/0001

## What happened
Similar to ALARM 66 but the resource limit is specified for a sidecar.

# ALARM 68
trial-02-0054/0001

## What happened
Same as ALARM 67.

# ALARM 69
trial-03-0038/0001

## What happened
Same as ALARM 67.

# ALARM 70
trial-00-0027/0001

## What happened
When acto sets `cr.spec.kubernetesConfig.imagePullSecret` to "INVALID_NAME" or some other invalid value which causes to pod to crash.

## Root Cause
The value for `imagePullSecret` is not valid. The operator code attempts to update the `SatetfullSet`  with the updated spec in `k8sutils/satefulset.go` without performing any validation on the statefulset spec. As the value is not valid the pod crashes when it tries to reconcile the state.

## Expected behavior?
This is a misoperation. The operator should handle this failure more gracefully. For example, after finding that the `imagePullSecret` value is invalid it should revert to the default value.

# ALARM 71

## What happened
Same as ALARM 70.

# ALARM 72

# ALARM 76
trial-03-0019/0001

## What happened
Same as ALARM 75.

# ALARM 77
trial-01-0049/0001

## What happened
When acto sets `cr.spec.nodeSelector` to to select a node that does not exist in the cluster, the pod enters an unhealthy state.

## Root Cause
Acto does not perform any validation to determine if the selected node exists. As such the operator code attempts to update the `SatetfullSet`  with the updated spec in `k8sutils/satefulset.go` without performing any validation on the statefulset spec. As the node does not exist the pod crashes when it tries to reconcile the state.

## Expected behavior?
This is a misoperation. The operator should check if the node exists before accepting the spec.

# ALARM 78
trial-01-0050/0001

## What happened
Same as ALARM 77.

# ALARM 79
trial-00-0001/0001

## What happened
When acto adds a storage volume claim using a resource that does not exist in the cluster, the pod enters an unhealthy state.

## Root Cause
The spec does not specify a valid sidecar. The operator code attempts to update the `SatetfullSet`  with the updated spec in `k8sutils/satefulset.go` without performing any validation on the statefulset spec. The requested resources under `nodeConfVolumeClaimTemplate` does not exist so when the cluster restarts it repeatedly fails as it is unable to create a pod as it cannot find the resource.

## Expected behavior?
This is a misoperation. The operator should be able to reject the spec by checking if the storage resource actually exists.

# ALARM 80
trial-00-0002/0001

## What happened
Similar to ALARM 79 but but the spec under `volumeMount` specifies a resource that does not exist.
